In this challenge, we were tasked with importing data from a json about resturants in the U.K. . 
We then had to update our database so that we had to include a new restaurant called Penang Flavours and update its businesstypeid.
Then for the final part we analyized the data and found out which restaurants were the best by rating and which ones to avoid.
